1. main and recur are in .text

2. .text is used for instructions that are going to be executed (ie functions)
.data is for static variables
.bss has unitialized variables that are all zeroes 

3. The stack is growing downward as evidenced by the addresses getting smaller.

4. 48 bytes

5. The heap is on top of the stack. The heap is growing upwards

6. They are not contiguous because there is a difference of 112 bytes between their address while an int should only take up 3

7. 
Higher addresses (0xFFFFFFFF)
~~~~~~~~
Stack (grows downward)
